/**
 * Dependency-free bridge facts shared by the CLI and the bridge process.

 * This module deliberately imports nothing but node builtins. `src/client.ts`
 * needs only these two symbols from the bridge, and `src/bridge.ts` statically
 * imports the MCP SDK (~45ms). Keeping them here means every CLI invocation -
 * `--version`, `--help`, every command - resolves the bridge script and the
 * port-collision exit code without loading an MCP client it never constructs.
 * `test/version-path.test.ts` guards that property.
