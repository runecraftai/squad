# tasks-axi

${DESCRIPTION}

You do not need tasks-axi installed globally - invoke it with \`npx -y tasks-axi <command>\`.
If tasks-axi output shows a follow-up command starting with \`tasks-axi\`, run it as \`npx -y tasks-axi ...\` instead.

tasks-axi operates on a hand-editable \`backlog.md\` in the current workspace (or the path set in \`.tasks.toml\`). It edits the file in place with a byte-exact round-trip, so the human-readable backlog stays the source of truth.

## When to use

Use tasks-axi whenever a task touches the backlog: filing or dispatching work, moving a task through queued -> in flight -> done, recording a PR url or report path on completion, tracking blocked-by dependencies, pausing dispatch with structured holds, finding dispatchable ready work or intentionally held work, or trimming the Done list.

## Workflow

1. Run \`npx -y tasks-axi\` with no arguments for a dashboard of the current backlog - in flight work, queued work with blockers, and suggested next commands.
2. Drill in verb-first: \`list\`, \`show <id>\`, \`ready\`, then mutate with \`add\`, \`start\`, \`done\`, \`block\`/\`unblock\`, \`hold\`/\`unhold\`, \`update\`.
3. The long notes never appear in \`list\`; run \`show <id> --full\` to read a task's complete body before replacing it.
4. \`add\` takes a caller-supplied id (the join key), e.g. \`tasks-axi add sq-x "title" --kind strike --repo Squad --start\`; or pass \`--mint\` to generate a slug-xx id from the title.
5. \`done <id> --pr <url>\` (or \`--report <path>\`) closes a task, records the link, and prunes the Done list (archived, never deleted). Then \`ready\` shows work it unblocked.
6. \`hold <id> --reason "<text>"\` pauses dispatch without prose parsing; \`ready\` excludes active holds by default, and \`ready --include-held\` shows a separate held group.
   Use \`--until YYYY-MM-DD\` for a date gate that becomes inactive on and after that date.
7. Human-readable responses include contextual next-step hints under \`help:\` when there is a useful follow-up - follow them.
8. \`--json\` mutation responses skip \`help:\` and return the deterministic result object instead.

## Commands

\`\`\`
${extractCommandsBlock()}
\`\`\`

Run \`npx -y tasks-axi --help\` for global flags, or \`npx -y tasks-axi <command> --help\` for per-command usage.

## Tips

- Output is TOON-encoded and token-efficient; the long task body is truncated by default - the whole point is that \`list\` stays cheap.
  Use \`--full\` only when you need the complete notes.
- Every write leads with an \`ok:\` line confirming the write result, including the resulting task state when the command changes one (e.g. \`ok: start <id> -> In flight\`, \`ok: done <id> -> Done (pr <url>)\`, \`ok: render -> normalized <n>\`), then state-aware next-step hints.
  Mutations are idempotent and add \`already: true\` on a no-op; re-running is safe.
- Pass \`--json\` to any mutation (\`add\`, \`start\`, \`done\`, \`reopen\`, \`update\`, \`rm\`, \`block\`, \`unblock\`, \`hold\`, \`unhold\`, \`mv\`, \`prune\`, \`render\`) for a machine-readable result object (\`{ "ok": true, "action": ..., "task": { ... } }\` or operation-specific result fields) instead of TOON - confirm a write deterministically without a follow-up read.
- \`block <id> --by <other>\` and \`unblock\` manage the dependency graph; \`hold <id> --reason "<text>" [--until YYYY-MM-DD]\` and \`unhold\` manage structured dispatch pauses; \`ready\` lists only queued work with no unresolved blocker and no active hold.
- Filter \`list\` with \`--state\`, \`--repo\`, \`--kind\`, \`--blocked\`, \`--limit\`, and add columns with \`--fields a,b,c\`.
  Use \`list --state held\` or \`--fields held,hold_reason,hold_kind,hold_until\` when scanning active hold state.
- Existing prose markers such as \`HELD\`, \`PARKED\`, \`DEFERRED\`, \`CAPTAIN-DECISION\`, and \`do not dispatch\` stay prose until intentionally migrated.
  Preserve the original prose as the hold reason, then choose \`commander\`, \`parked\`, \`future\`, \`load\`, or \`external\` only when the text supports that bucket.
- Note writes are inspect-then-update: run \`show <id> --full\`, then replace the curated current body with \`update <id> --body "<text>"\` or \`--body-file <path>\`.
  Add \`--archive-body\` to preserve the superseded body in \`note-archive.md\`; \`--title "<text>"\` replaces the title; \`render\` normalizes the file; \`mv <id> [<id>...] --to <path>\` moves one or more tasks to another backlog in one atomic transaction - pass a whole connected set (a blocker and its dependents) to move it together and preserve its \`blocked-by\` links and reason strings; moves that would strand an endpoint are refused.
- Free-form (no-id) backlog lines are preserved verbatim and are never modified.
