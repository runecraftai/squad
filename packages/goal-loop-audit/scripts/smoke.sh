# pi-goal-list-loop-audit — live integration smoke
#
# Drives a real pi session in tmux against a scratch dir and asserts on the
# .pi-glla ledger. This is the M2 "integration harness": it exercises the full
# loop (goal → agent work → complete_goal → isolated auditor → archive) with
# real models, which unit tests cannot do.
#
# Requirements: tmux, pi, a built-in provider with quota. The session runs
# on MAIN_MODEL (env-overridable); the auditor uses the same pi session model
# — the plugin never picks models, so there is no separate auditor model to
# configure here.
#
# Usage:  scripts/smoke.sh [scenario]
#   scenario: goal (default) | list | draft | draft-reject | loop | bamboozle
#
# The loop scenario runs under a BARE PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR (auth.json only)
# so global extensions (pi-loop-mode's /loop collision, kilocode provider)
# stay out of the way; the main model is the built-in free opencode one.
#
# Exit code 0 = all assertions passed.
