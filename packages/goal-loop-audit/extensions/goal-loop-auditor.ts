/**
 * pi-goal-list-loop-audit — v0.1.0
 * extensions/goal-loop-auditor.ts
 *
 * Isolated completion auditor. Runs in a fresh pi agent session with no
 * extensions, no skills, no prompts, no themes, no editor. Only read tools.
 *
 * Two enforced floors: the auditor must call at least one read tool before
 * <approved/>, and regression_shield (goal-loop-shield.ts) requires the
 * report to include raw output (cat / grep / bash) for every must-verify
 * item in the verification contract — the orchestrator rejects
 * evidence-free approvals.
